Just another newbie here

Hi brothers!

I am Novruz, from Turkmenistan. 
Currently studying in Chinese University and about to graduate in June.
Now I am working on my graduation project that involves developing object detection system.
Using KUKA KR210 as a test bench robot, I need to make him to detect and grab a straight pipe.
